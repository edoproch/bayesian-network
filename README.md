# Comparison of execution time and precision between approximate and exact inference in Bayesian Networks
I did this project during my master for the module 3 of the subject Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation.
The aim of my work was to understand in which situations it is better to use exact inference and when to use the approximate approach.

The folder contains the following files:
* asma.xlsx which is the dataset used to build to network
* network.ipynb which is the notebook that contains all the code
* project\_report_procino.pdf which is the report of the project, here I explain my idea and the achieved results.
